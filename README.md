• Automated Gem5 simulator via shell script for observing x86 processor performance under varied cache parameters.

• Incorporated a feature in the shell **script to dump terminal output data** in a text file, ensuring data preservation.

• Streamlined the process of executing each of the 21 commands and saving terminal output, reducing manual efforts.

• Significantly improved efficiency by optimizing workflow and **transforming a 4-hour task into a mere 2-minute job**.
